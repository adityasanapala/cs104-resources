# Contribution

If you want to add a resource to this repo, fork this repo on Github (Make sure you have a Github account...) and push your resources into your repo and send a pull request and hope for the request to be accepted...

Or you could just DM me the file and I will try to reply quickly.

You can import the CS108-Midsem profile for VS Code in the repo (File -> Preferences -> Profiles -> Import Profile).

I would recommend just importing the profile as .vsix file is a bit outdated
